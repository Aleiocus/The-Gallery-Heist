Hello fellow Toons!

This is the v1 Readme for ValSprites Platformer Prototype.

I have done my best to make things legible and understandable. All you have to do is import the project.godot file into Godot on your machine and you will be ready to roll.

This project so far has three different size test players, the plan is everyone tries out Godot with this prebuild and we see what we can do together. I don't know a lot about programming but I can explain everything here and a little about Godot if you haven't already been watching tutuorials.
